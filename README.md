# GlobeTrotter
The Globe Trotter application for the odoo hackathon submission 


WE couldnt complete the project , it was a very good problem statement and many things we had in mind , we focused on the auth routes and security too much that the core functionality of the project was compromised , it was a very good learning experience and we would like to work more on this project
